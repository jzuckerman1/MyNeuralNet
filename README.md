# MyNeuralNet

This is my approach to creating a Neural Network in python. A significant proportion of this project was inspired by videos from 3Blue1Brown. Along with that, this will come heavily inspired from Neural Networks and Deep Learning, the free online book. It can be reached [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). This project can serve as an updated version as the online book is outdated.
